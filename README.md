###Build

Building Preference Spy requires the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) compiler available on the environment `PATH` and an installation of Komodo Edit or IDE.
The [`ko-preferencespy`](https://github.com/ervumlens/ko-preferencespy) repository includes Komodo macros that build the extension.
Just clone the repo, open a new Komodo project from within the `ko-preferencespy` directory, and run the macros from the Komodo toolbox.
